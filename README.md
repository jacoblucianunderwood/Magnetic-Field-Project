# Magnetic-Field-Project

Originally a project in Physics 2 (Electricity, Magnetism, and Light) course, this was a code intended to simply calculate the magnetic field about a current-carrying loop at a set position with respect to the loop. Now the project has evolved to be a vectorized code with the help of numpy in Python while also having an edition for MATLAB.

The current goal of the code currently is to produce an accurate visual of the magnetic field about this current carrying loop. The current challenge is to find a way to produce that visual in such a way that it does not produce lag when someone tries to turn the model.

In the future, I intend to incorporate more models than just this simple loop, one such idea being a solenoid I'd like to try creating within the code.
